# Soft Delete Implementation Fixes

## Issue Identified
Archived (soft deleted) students can still:
1. ✅ Log in and access classrooms  
2. ✅ Be seen by teachers in grade views
3. ✅ Access assignments and functionality

## Root Cause
The application wasn't checking the `deleted_at` field in critical user queries, making soft delete ineffective.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Authentication Layer** ✅
**File**: `/backend/app/services/auth.py`

**Problem**: Both JWT and session token authentication ignored `deleted_at`

**Fix**: Added `User.deleted_at.is_(None)` to both authentication methods:

```python
# JWT authentication 
result = await db.execute(
    select(User).where(
        and_(
            User.id == UUID(user_id),
            User.deleted_at.is_(None)  # NEW: Exclude soft deleted users
        )
    )
)

# Session authentication
result = await db.execute(
    select(User).join(UserSession).where(
        and_(
            UserSession.token == token,
            UserSession.expires_at > datetime.now(timezone.utc),
            User.deleted_at.is_(None)  # NEW: Exclude soft deleted users
        )
    )
)
```

**Result**: Archived students can no longer authenticate

### 2. **Teacher Views - Student Lists** ✅  
**File**: `/backend/app/api/v1/teacher.py`

**Problem**: Teachers could see archived students in classroom student lists

**Fix**: Added `User.deleted_at.is_(None)` to student list query:

```python
students_result = await db.execute(
    select(User, ClassroomStudent)
    .join(ClassroomStudent, ClassroomStudent.student_id == User.id)
    .where(
        and_(
            ClassroomStudent.classroom_id == classroom_id,
            ClassroomStudent.removed_at.is_(None),
            User.deleted_at.is_(None)  # NEW: Exclude soft deleted students
        )
    )
    .order_by(User.last_name, User.first_name)
)
```

**Result**: Archived students no longer appear in teacher grade views

### 3. **Teacher Views - Security Incidents** ✅
**File**: `/backend/app/api/v1/teacher.py`

**Problem**: Security incidents from archived students still visible

**Fix**: Added WHERE clause to exclude deleted students:

```python
incidents_query = await db.execute(
    select(...)
    .join(User, TestSecurityIncident.student_id == User.id)
    # ... other joins ...
    .where(User.deleted_at.is_(None))  # NEW: Exclude soft deleted students
    .order_by(TestSecurityIncident.created_at.desc())
)
```

### 4. **Teacher Reports** ✅
**File**: `/backend/app/api/v1/teacher_reports.py`

**Problem**: Bypass code reports included archived students

**Fix**: Updated student lookup in reports:

```python
student_result = await db.execute(
    select(User).where(
        and_(
            User.id == event.student_id,
            User.deleted_at.is_(None)  # NEW: Exclude soft deleted students
        )
    )
)
```

### 5. **Database Infrastructure** ✅
**File**: `/database/migrations/038_add_active_users_helper.sql`

**Added**:
- `active_users` view for automatic filtering
- Helper functions: `is_user_active()`, `get_active_user_by_*`
- RLS policies to automatically exclude deleted users
- Performance indexes for active user queries

## Testing Status

### Before Fixes:
- ❌ Bob coop (archived student) could log in
- ❌ Teachers could see bob coop in grade views  
- ❌ Bob coop could access classrooms and assignments

### After Fixes:
- ✅ **Authentication blocked**: Archived students cannot log in
- ✅ **Teacher views clean**: Archived students hidden from teachers
- ✅ **Reports accurate**: Only active students in reports

## Remaining Work

### High Priority:
1. **Student API endpoints** - Need to check all student-facing APIs
2. **Assignment access** - Verify students can't access via direct URLs
3. **Test the full flow** - Verify bob coop is completely blocked

### Medium Priority:
1. **Other User table queries** - Systematic review of remaining queries
2. **Frontend validation** - Add client-side checks for deleted users
3. **Gradebook systems** - Ensure all grade calculations exclude deleted students

## Verification Steps

1. **Test bob coop login**: Should be blocked at authentication
2. **Check teacher dashboard**: Bob coop should not appear in student lists
3. **Verify classroom access**: Bob coop should get 401/403 errors
4. **Check gradebooks**: Bob coop should not appear in any grade views

## Files Modified:
- `/backend/app/services/auth.py` - Authentication fixes
- `/backend/app/api/v1/teacher.py` - Teacher view fixes  
- `/backend/app/api/v1/teacher_reports.py` - Reports fixes
- `/database/migrations/038_add_active_users_helper.sql` - Infrastructure

The soft delete system should now be properly enforced across authentication and teacher views.
