# Database Audit Results: User "herb coop" Deletion

## Audit Date: June 9, 2025
## User Details:
- **ID:** 1fadf478-d451-459b-9c2c-284c2e18a558
- **Email:** hcoop@csd8.info
- **Name:** herb coop
- **Status:** Soft deleted (not permanently deleted)

## Key Finding: ⚠️ USER NOT PERMANENTLY DELETED

The user still exists in the `users` table with:
- `deleted_at`: 2025-06-09 16:45:06.689392+00
- `deletion_reason`: "hard_delete_requested"

## Orphaned Records Found:

### 1. **classroom_students** - 1 record
```
classroom_id: caf9da0a-8d2e-4461-a7f5-c8168fc9ad14
classroom_name: "English P 1"
```
**Impact:** User still enrolled in classroom

### 2. **student_assignments** - 2 records
```
Assignment 1: 6f4bd956-1dc4-494b-a1d0-f42e3aa0e6d9 (in_progress)
Assignment 2: e225453c-daf2-41c3-84f6-870c3feb16bb (in_progress)
```
**Impact:** Active assignments still assigned to deleted user

### 3. **student_test_attempts** - 2 records
**Impact:** Test history retained

### 4. **umaread_student_responses** - Unknown count
**Impact:** UMARead response data retained

### 5. **umaread_chunk_progress** - 9 records
**Impact:** Reading progress data retained

### 6. **umaread_assignment_progress** - 2 records
**Impact:** Assignment progress data retained

## Tables Checked (Clean):
- ✅ **classrooms** - No classrooms owned by user
- ✅ **reading_assignments** - No assignments created by user
- ✅ **student_events** - No events recorded

## Root Cause Analysis:

1. **Soft Delete Implementation**: The "hard delete" function actually performed a soft delete, not a permanent deletion
2. **Missing CASCADE DELETE**: Foreign key constraints don't have CASCADE DELETE, leaving orphaned records
3. **No Cleanup Process**: No automated cleanup of related data when user is deleted

## Recommendations:

### Immediate Cleanup Required:
```sql
-- Remove classroom enrollment
DELETE FROM classroom_students 
WHERE student_id = '1fadf478-d451-459b-9c2c-284c2e18a558';

-- Remove student assignments
DELETE FROM student_assignments 
WHERE student_id = '1fadf478-d451-459b-9c2c-284c2e18a558';

-- Remove test attempts
DELETE FROM student_test_attempts 
WHERE student_id = '1fadf478-d451-459b-9c2c-284c2e18a558';

-- Remove UMARead data
DELETE FROM umaread_student_responses 
WHERE student_id = '1fadf478-d451-459b-9c2c-284c2e18a558';

DELETE FROM umaread_chunk_progress 
WHERE student_id = '1fadf478-d451-459b-9c2c-284c2e18a558';

DELETE FROM umaread_assignment_progress 
WHERE student_id = '1fadf478-d451-459b-9c2c-284c2e18a558';

-- Finally, permanently delete the user
DELETE FROM users 
WHERE id = '1fadf478-d451-459b-9c2c-284c2e18a558';
```

### Long-term Fixes:
1. **Fix hard delete function** to actually perform permanent deletion
2. **Add CASCADE DELETE constraints** to foreign keys
3. **Implement proper cleanup procedures** for user deletion
4. **Add transaction handling** to ensure atomic deletion

## Security Implications:
- User data remains accessible through foreign key relationships
- Progress and test data could be linked back to the "deleted" user
- Classroom relationships persist, potentially affecting reporting

## Next Steps:
1. Run the cleanup SQL commands above
2. Verify complete deletion with follow-up audit
3. Fix the hard delete implementation in the admin system
4. Consider adding database constraints to prevent future orphaned records
