# Word Puzzle Path Fix Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes implemented for the Word Puzzle Path assignment to allow students to retake after failing.

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. Status Handling on Completion
- **Changed**: Modified `submit_puzzle_answer` to always set status to `'pending_confirmation'` when complete, regardless of score
- **Location**: `app/services/vocabulary_practice.py` line 1384
- **Impact**: Ensures the completion dialog shows for both pass (≥70%) and fail (<70%) scenarios

### 2. Enhanced Decline Functionality
- **Changed**: Updated `decline_puzzle_completion` to delete ALL puzzle responses for the student and vocabulary list
- **Location**: `app/services/vocabulary_practice.py` lines 1704-1714
- **Previous**: Only deleted responses for specific attempt number
- **Now**: Deletes all responses to ensure complete cleanup

### 3. Session Resume Error Handling
- **Added**: Try/catch block in `start_puzzle_path` to handle stale sessions gracefully
- **Location**: `app/services/vocabulary_practice.py` lines 974-980
- **Impact**: Prevents crashes when resuming with deleted attempts

### 4. Orphaned Response Cleanup
- **Added**: Automatic cleanup of orphaned responses from previous attempts during submission
- **Location**: `app/services/vocabulary_practice.py` lines 1293-1317
- **Impact**: Prevents old responses from interfering with new attempts

### 5. Stale State Recovery
- **Added**: Logic to detect and fix cases where responses exist but counters weren't updated
- **Location**: `app/services/vocabulary_practice.py` lines 1356-1373
- **Impact**: Allows progression through puzzles even if previous attempt had issues

### 6. Enhanced Attempt Number Generation
- **Improved**: `_get_next_attempt_number` now checks both practice_status AND database for max attempt number
- **Location**: `app/services/vocabulary_practice.py` lines 305-326
- **Impact**: Ensures unique attempt numbers even after deletions

## Key Differences from Concept Mapping

1. **Answer Evaluation**: Word Puzzle uses answer keys (`correct_answer` field) instead of real-time AI evaluation
2. **Puzzle Generation**: Puzzles are generated once and reused across attempts
3. **Response Handling**: Must handle cases where old responses exist from previous attempts

## Testing Scenarios

### Failed Attempt Flow
1. Complete puzzle path with score < 70%
2. Dialog appears with "Retake Assignment Later" button
3. Click "Retake Assignment Later"
4. Start new attempt - should work without errors
5. Progress through all puzzles with proper evaluation

### Successful Attempt Flow
1. Complete puzzle path with score ≥ 70%
2. Dialog appears with "Complete Assignment" button
3. Click "Complete Assignment"
4. Assignment marked as completed in practice progress

### Edge Cases Handled
- Stale responses from previous attempts are cleaned up
- Duplicate submissions don't break progression
- Attempt numbers increment properly after decline
- Redis session cleanup prevents stale session errors

## Final State
The Word Puzzle Path now:
- ✅ Shows completion dialog for both pass and fail
- ✅ Allows retakes after failing
- ✅ Properly cleans up data on decline
- ✅ Handles orphaned responses gracefully
- ✅ Maintains accurate progress tracking
- ✅ Evaluates answers correctly on retakes
