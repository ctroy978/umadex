# User Deletion Audit Report: "herb coop"

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive audit to verify the complete deletion of a user named "herb coop" from the UMADex database. The audit covers all tables that may contain references to users and identifies potential orphaned records.

## Database Schema Analysis

Based on the examination of 35 database migrations and all model files, the following user relationships were identified:

### Tables with Foreign Key Constraints (CASCADE DELETE)
These tables should automatically clean up when a user is deleted:

1. **user_sessions** - CASCADE DELETE on user_id
2. **refresh_tokens** - CASCADE DELETE on user_id  
3. **student_events** - CASCADE DELETE on student_id
4. **vocabulary_lists** - CASCADE DELETE on teacher_id
5. **answer_evaluations** - CASCADE DELETE on student_id
6. **reading_assignments** - No explicit CASCADE (potential orphan)
7. **assignment_images** - CASCADE through reading_assignments
8. **reading_chunks** - CASCADE through reading_assignments
9. **student_test_attempts** - No explicit CASCADE on student_id (potential orphan)
10. **test_results** - No explicit CASCADE on student_id (potential orphan)

### Tables with Soft References (NO CASCADE)
These tables may contain orphaned records:

1. **otp_requests** - email field only, no foreign key
2. **classroom_students** - References users but no CASCADE
3. **classrooms** - teacher_id reference, no CASCADE
4. **classroom_assignments** - Indirect reference through classrooms
5. **student_assignments** - student_id reference, no CASCADE
6. **assignment_tests** - approved_by reference, no CASCADE
7. **teacher_bypass_codes** - teacher_id and student_id references
8. **test_security_incidents** - student_id reference
9. **classroom_test_schedules** - created_by_teacher_id reference
10. **classroom_test_overrides** - teacher_id reference
11. **test_override_usage** - student_id reference

### Audit and History Tables
1. **user_deletions** - Should contain deletion record
2. **admin_actions** - May contain admin activities
3. **role_changes** - user_id and changed_by references

### UMARead Progress Tables
1. **umaread_student_responses** - student_id reference
2. **umaread_chunk_progress** - student_id reference  
3. **umaread_assignment_progress** - student_id reference
4. **reading_student_responses** - student_id reference (legacy)
5. **reading_cache_flush_log** - teacher_id reference

## Soft Delete Implementation

The database implements soft deletion for users:
- **deleted_at** - Timestamp when user was soft deleted
- **deleted_by** - Admin who performed the deletion
- **deletion_reason** - Reason for deletion

## Running the Audit

Execute the queries in `/home/tcoop/projects/umadex/user_deletion_audit.sql` in sequence:

### Step 1: Verify User Deletion
Check if "herb coop" exists in the users table (including soft-deleted records).

### Step 2: Check Deletion Logs
Verify the deletion was properly logged in audit tables.

### Step 3-11: Check All Related Tables
Systematically check each table for orphaned references.

## Expected Results for Complete Deletion

### If Hard Deleted:
- No records in `users` table
- Record in `user_deletions` table with `deletion_type = 'hard'`
- Zero counts in all CASCADE DELETE tables
- Potential orphaned records in non-CASCADE tables

### If Soft Deleted:
- Record in `users` table with `deleted_at` populated
- Record in `user_deletions` table with `deletion_type = 'soft'`
- All relationships preserved but user marked as deleted

## Critical Orphan Risks

Tables most likely to contain orphaned records after hard deletion:

1. **otp_requests** - No foreign key constraint
2. **classrooms** - Teacher-owned classrooms may remain
3. **classroom_students** - Student enrollment records
4. **reading_assignments** - Teacher-created assignments
5. **student_assignments** - Student progress records
6. **test_results** - Student test scores
7. **student_test_attempts** - Test attempt history
8. **umaread_*_responses** - UMARead progress data

## Cleanup Recommendations

If orphaned records are found, consider these cleanup approaches:

### For Teacher Records (if herb coop was a teacher):
```sql
-- Soft delete classrooms
UPDATE classrooms SET deleted_at = NOW() WHERE teacher_id = '<herb_coop_id>';

-- Archive assignments  
UPDATE reading_assignments SET deleted_at = NOW() WHERE teacher_id = '<herb_coop_id>';

-- Archive vocabulary lists
UPDATE vocabulary_lists SET deleted_at = NOW() WHERE teacher_id = '<herb_coop_id>';
```

### For Student Records (if herb coop was a student):
```sql
-- Remove from classroom enrollments
UPDATE classroom_students 
SET removed_at = NOW(), removed_by = '<admin_user_id>' 
WHERE student_id = '<herb_coop_id>';

-- Clean up progress data (if desired)
DELETE FROM umaread_student_responses WHERE student_id = '<herb_coop_id>';
DELETE FROM umaread_chunk_progress WHERE student_id = '<herb_coop_id>';
DELETE FROM umaread_assignment_progress WHERE student_id = '<herb_coop_id>';
```

### For Audit Data:
```sql
-- Clean up orphaned OTP requests
DELETE FROM otp_requests WHERE email LIKE '%herb%coop%';
```

## Security Considerations

- Review `student_events` for any bypass code usage
- Check `test_security_incidents` for any test violations
- Verify `admin_actions` logs for any suspicious activity
- Ensure `teacher_bypass_codes` are revoked

## Data Retention Policies

Consider your organization's data retention requirements:
- Student progress data may need to be retained for academic records
- Test results might be required for grade reporting
- Audit logs should typically be preserved for compliance

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] User not found in active users query
- [ ] Deletion properly logged in audit tables
- [ ] No orphaned authentication records
- [ ] Classroom relationships properly handled
- [ ] Assignment data appropriately archived or deleted
- [ ] Test data cleaned up per retention policy
- [ ] UMARead progress data addressed
- [ ] All audit logs reviewed for completeness

## Follow-up Actions

After running the audit:

1. **Document findings** - Record which tables contained orphaned data
2. **Clean up orphans** - Remove or archive orphaned records as appropriate
3. **Update procedures** - Improve deletion procedures to prevent future orphans
4. **Verify constraints** - Consider adding missing CASCADE DELETE constraints
5. **Test deletion process** - Ensure future deletions are complete
