# AI Vocabulary Evaluator Setup Guide

## Overview
The vocabulary evaluator now **requires** AI evaluation - there is no fallback method. This ensures accurate and nuanced evaluation of student vocabulary definitions.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed All Fallback Methods
- Deleted `_fallback_evaluate_definition()` method
- Deleted `_create_error_response()` method
- AI evaluation is now mandatory

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- System will raise an exception if no AI service is configured
- Clear error messages indicate what needs to be set up
- Comprehensive logging tracks AI evaluation process

### 3. Improved AI Prompt (Stricter Scoring)
The AI prompt now emphasizes:
- Wrong answers must receive low scores (0-15%)
- Accuracy is paramount over effort
- Clear scoring examples for wrong vs. correct answers
- No minimum score guarantees

## Setup Requirements

### Environment Variables
You MUST set at least one of these environment variables:

```bash
# Option 1: Use Google Gemini (Recommended - consistent with rest of app)
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key-here"

# Option 2: Use Claude
export CLAUDE_API_KEY="your-claude-api-key-here"

# Option 3: Use OpenAI
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"

# Option 4: Set multiple (system will prefer Gemini, then Claude, then OpenAI)
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key-here"
export CLAUDE_API_KEY="your-claude-api-key-here"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"
```

### Getting API Keys
1. **Gemini API Key**: Sign up at https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
2. **Claude API Key**: Sign up at https://console.anthropic.com/
3. **OpenAI API Key**: Sign up at https://platform.openai.com/

## Testing the Setup

Run the diagnostic script to verify everything is working:

```bash
python test_ai_vocabulary_diagnostic.py
```

Expected output when properly configured:
```
✓ Successfully imported AIVocabularyEvaluator
✓ AI Available: True
✓ Evaluation successful!
```

## Error Messages and Solutions

### "AI evaluation is required but no AI service is configured"
**Solution**: Set GEMINI_API_KEY, CLAUDE_API_KEY, or OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable

### "AI evaluation failed: [error details]"
**Possible causes**:
1. Invalid API key
2. Network connectivity issues
3. API service is down
4. Rate limiting

**Solutions**:
1. Verify API key is correct
2. Check internet connection
3. Check API service status
4. Wait and retry if rate limited

## Expected Scoring Behavior

With the new strict AI evaluation:
- "discord" → "love": ~5-15%
- "incite" → "to put on makeup": ~5-15%
- "defunct" → "to make cool music": ~5-15%
- "circumvent" → "to go around": ~70-85%
- "spurious" → "fake or false": ~85-95%

## Important Notes

1. **No Partial Credit for Wrong Answers**: The system will not give points just for trying
2. **Context Matters**: The AI evaluates based on the example sentence context
3. **Grade Level Considered**: The AI adjusts expectations based on student grade level
4. **Detailed Feedback**: Even low scores come with constructive feedback

## Monitoring and Logs

The system now logs:
- Whether AI evaluation is being attempted
- Which AI service is being used (Gemini, Claude, or OpenAI)
- Success/failure of API calls
- Detailed error messages if evaluation fails

Check application logs for entries like:
```
INFO: AI evaluation available: True
INFO: Gemini API key present: True (length: 39)
INFO: Starting AI evaluation for 'discord': 'love'
INFO: Attempting to call Gemini API
INFO: AI evaluation successful for 'discord': score=8
```

## Production Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Set API key environment variables
- [ ] Test with diagnostic script
- [ ] Verify network access to AI APIs
- [ ] Set up error monitoring/alerting
- [ ] Configure API rate limits if needed
- [ ] Test with sample vocabulary words
- [ ] Monitor initial student evaluations
