# Vocabulary Evaluator Fix Summary

## Changes Made to `/backend/app/services/ai_vocabulary_evaluator.py`

### 1. Enhanced Logging and Debugging
- Added comprehensive logging throughout the evaluation flow
- Logs now track whether AI or fallback evaluation is being used
- Added detailed error logging with stack traces for API failures
- Logs API availability status and which API keys are present

### 2. Fixed AI Evaluation Prompt (Stricter Scoring)
- **Removed generous base scoring** - No more automatic 20+ points for any attempt
- **Added explicit wrong answer examples** with low scores (0-15%)
- **Emphasized accuracy over effort** - Wrong answers must receive low scores
- **Updated scoring bands:**
  - Completely wrong: 0-5 points
  - Minimal understanding: 5-10 points
  - Partial understanding: 10-20 points
  - Mostly correct: 20-30 points
  - Correct: 30-40 points
- **Removed minimum score guarantees** - No more 50% minimum for any attempt

### 3. Overhauled Fallback Evaluation Method
- **Starts at 0 points** instead of 20 base points
- **Added wrong answer detection** for common incorrect patterns
- **Stricter word overlap requirements:**
  - 50%+ overlap needed for excellent score (vs 30% before)
  - 35%+ overlap for good score (vs 20% before)
  - Less than 20% overlap gets minimal points
- **Context and completeness scores now depend on accuracy**
- **Removed automatic score inflation** - No minimum guarantees

### 4. Test Results (Fallback Method)
The new strict scoring produces these results:
- "discord" → "love": **9%** (was ~75%)
- "benevolent" → "trying hard": **15%** (was ~70%)
- "incite" → "to put on makeup": **14%** (was ~75%)
- "circumvent" → "to go around": **52%** (was ~80%)
- "defunct" → "to make cool music": **14%** (was ~75%)
- "spurious" → "fake or false": **79%** (was ~95%)

## How to Enable AI Evaluation

To use AI evaluation instead of fallback:
1. Set environment variable `CLAUDE_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY`
2. The system will automatically prefer Claude if both are available
3. Check logs to confirm AI evaluation is being used

## Monitoring
The enhanced logging will show:
- Which evaluation method is being used (AI or fallback)
- Why AI might be failing (missing API keys, network errors, etc.)
- Detailed scoring breakdowns for debugging
